You have found a Zev Zev!

Back to the board
Based around "The White Board" from slap city / ludosity in general since BCM was born in there.
Personally my favorite one of the three.
Fun fact : It was supposed to be longer and basically being a "Draft" Intro part > Idea 1 > intro part > idea 2 . 
fitting with the term " Back to the Board "

Also i really made this hard for myself LOL!
Bcm is a very weird character for music , just the music part was the one that took like 3 months to make
Really hard to find a theme for a Buzzword Corporate Entrepeneur that want to get to the top  and bend rules
like . . . rock? techno?
its hard . . .
So I based around stuff he was in
Back to the Board : His first appearence
Buzzword : His way of speech
Office Buster : Slap City's Office Surfer. 

There are some other ones that i WILL add on full rel but right now i just need a LITTLE BIT OF  TIME ARTHUR!
